The CoolLED1248 program controls color LED panels and uses .JT files.

However, it is horrible to edit these on the mobile phone.  This project aims to create a browser based editor to allow for computer based editing.

It should support manual manipulation of individual pixes in the 3 bit (aka 7 + black) color space, as well as importing jpg images (and rasterizing them down to 3 bit color), and exporting to JT format.

At this point in time the export function is NOT 100% correct.  However, much work has been done on the other steps.  Please contribute any changes you make on your system by sending a pull request!
